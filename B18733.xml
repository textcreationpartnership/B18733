            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF WILLIAM ADDERLEY Esq; Duly Elected a Burgess to serve in Parliament for the Burrough of <hi>New Windsor</hi> in the County of <hi>Berks.</hi>

            <p>THE Burrough of <hi>New Windsor</hi> sends Two Burgesses to serve in Parliament by Prescription.</p>
            <p>By a Charter 5 <hi>Edward</hi> the First, the King Grants that, <hi>Probi homines ejusdem Villae sint Liberi Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genses habeant Gildam Mercatoriam,</hi> and Returns of Members of Parliament were made accordingly, and all <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth time, the Returns were <hi>Major &amp; Communitas Burgensium elegerunt, &amp;c.</hi> such and such to serve in Parliament.</p>
            <p>In the Sixth of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, that King for express Consideration, that the Inhabitants of <hi>Windsor</hi> had quitted a Right of Common, in Two Hundred Acres of Land, (now His Majesties House Park there;) he Incorporates the Mayor, Bayliffs, Burgesses and Inhabitants, by the Name of Mayor, Bayliffs and Burgesses, whereby every Inhabitant became a Burgess of the Corporation, as well as of the Burrough.</p>
            <p>That by the Charter of King <hi>James</hi> the First, they were then formed into a Select Number of Brothers of the Hall not exceeding Thirty, which (like the rest of the Charters,) makes no mention of sending Burgesses to Parliament.</p>
            <p>Of late years the Selected Number of Brothers, not exceeding Thirty, have pretended to have the sole choice, but whenever that matter came to be determined by this Honourable House, their Pretences always proved groundless, as being contrary to all the antient Returns made of Members, to serve for that place, and particularly in <hi>December</hi> 1640. the Question being, whether the Inhabitants in General, or a Particular Choice by Mayor, Bayliffs, and some few of the Town should have Power of Election, this Honorable House then Unanimously Resolved, that the Inhabitants of Right, ought to Choose, and not the Special Men, which are the Words of the Journal.</p>
            <p>The matter came again to be Controverted in <hi>April</hi> 1679, and the Question was, Whether the Mayor, Bayliffs and Burgesses, not exceeding the Number of Thirty, or the Inhabitants at large, had the Right to Vote in Election to Parliament; The House Resolved, That the Mayor, Bayliffs and Burgesses of <hi>New Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,</hi> not exceeding the Number of Thirty, had not the Right of Election of Members to serve in Parliament for the Burrough of <hi>New Windsor.</hi> And Secondly, Resolved, That <hi>New Windsor</hi> has a Right to send Burgesses to Parliament by Prescription. And Thirdly, Resolved, That all the Inhabitants of the Burrough of <hi>New Windsor,</hi> have the Right of Electing Members to serve in Parliament, and Mr. <hi>Windwood</hi> and Mr. <hi>Starkey</hi> had the Majority of the Inhabitants, (tho' the Mayor refused to admit their Voices) were by the House adjudged legally Chosen, and the Mayor ordered to amend the Return.</p>
            <p>And Lastly, in <hi>November</hi> 1680, about the Election of <hi>New VVindsor,</hi> his Honorable House again did Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, That in the Burrough of <hi>New VVindsor,</hi> those Inhabitants who pay Scot and Lot, have a Right to give Voices in the Election of Burgesses to serve in Parliament for the said Burrough.</p>
            <p>And on the day, and at the usual place of Election, <hi>viz.</hi> at he Market Cross, Mr. <hi>Adderley</hi> attended with the common Burgesses and Inhabitants, paying Scot and Lot, who duly chose the said Mr. <hi>Adderley,</hi> and thereupon Mr. <hi>Adderley</hi> went to the Town Hall, and demanded the Mayor to receive the Voices of the said Burgesses and Inhabitants, and Return him, being by them Chosen, who refused, saying, he would Return Sir <hi>Christopher Wren</hi> and <hi>Henry Powle</hi> Esq; for that he and his Brethren (being the Select Number) had Chosen them.</p>
